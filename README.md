# Front-End Capstone - NSS Cohort 48 - Lang-Flix

## Overview

As a learner of a second-language, I've tried my fairshare of langage-learning apps. While many of these apps claim to be the *fastest* or the *easiest* way to **learn** a language, whether or not any of the users can become actually **fluent** using their app is yet to be seen.
What most people *have seen* is someone living in another country for an extended period of time and suddenly becoming fluent in that country's language. Seemingly by magic, as no apps or classes were implemented in gaining this fluency. **Immersion** is the only way we know works in the acquiring of a second language. No app, class, or method can take it's place. However, we all cannot just takeoff to another country to expose ourself to an immersive environment...that's where watching foreign or dubbed films and television comes into play. Simply watching films and shows in your target-language is fastly becoming agreed upon to be one of the most effective means of learning a language. That's where Lang-Flix comes into play.

**Lang-Flix** is an immersion tracking app for language learners. Users sign up, select the language they're learning, and then are able to track the amount of time they've spent being immersed in their target language. Using the IMDb API, the user can search for the movie they've watched and add it to their profile. Their profile then tracks the runtime and tallies it to a total runtime. This total gives the user a goal of 1000 hours. Their profile also shows the movie titles, posters, and plots of the movies, so they can review everything they've watched along their journey. After reaching 1000 hours of immersion, I guarantee they will have more competence in that language than any class or app could provide; all while just watching cool movies.


### Features
